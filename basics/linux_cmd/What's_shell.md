# What is "The Shell"?
the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform.
On most Linux systems a program called bash acts as the shell program.
There are other shell programs available in a Linux system such as ksh, tcsh and zsh.

## What's A "Terminal" ?
It's a program that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell.

## Starting A Terminal
Ctrl + Alt + T

## Testing The Keyboard
You should see a shell prompt that contains your username and the name of the machine followed by a dollar sign. Something like this.
```
me@linuxbox me $
```
Now, you can type command!

## Using The Mouse
Even though the shell is a command line interface, the mouse is still handy.
you can scroll the contents of terminal window, copy text, drag your mouse over some text.
