# Shell Functions
As programs get longer and more complex, they become more difficult to design, code, and maintain. As with any large endeavor, it is often useful to break a single, large task into a series of smaller tasks.
The process of identifying the top-level steps and developing increasingly detailed views of those steps is called top-down design. This technique allows you to break large complex tasks into many small, simple tasks.
If we look at our script's top-level tasks, we find the following list:

1. Open page
2. Open head section
3. Write title
4. Close head section
5. Open body section
6. Write title
7. Write time stam
