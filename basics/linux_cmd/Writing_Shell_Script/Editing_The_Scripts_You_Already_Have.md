# Editing The scripts you already have
You already have some scripts of your own. These scripts were put into your home directory when your account was created, and are used to configure the behavior of your session on the computer. You can edit these scripts to change things.

a number of facts about the world in its memory that the system is holding is called the environment. The environment contains such things as your path, your username, the name of the file where your mail is delivered, and much more. You can see a complete list of what is in your environment with the **set** command.

## How is the Environment Established?

When you log on to the system, the bash program starts, and reads a series of configuration scripts called **startup files**
