# I/O Redirection
we can redirect the output of many commands to files, devices, and even to the input of other commands.

## Standard Output
Standard output directs its contents to the display. To redirect standard output to a file, the ">" character is used like this:
```bash
[me@linuxbox me]$ ls > file_list.txt
```
