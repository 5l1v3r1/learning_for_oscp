# Basic Python Command and Function

## I/O (Input/Output)
One of the basic tasks in any programming language, the ability to take input and give output is essential.

raw_input() - take input of any kind
print - display information to the screen

## Print Formatting
print "%[format_character]" % (corresponding data)
'd' - Signed integer decimal
'i' - Signed integer decimal
'x' - Signed hexadecimal
'e' - Floating point exponential format
'f' - Float point decimal format.
'c' - Single character
'r' - String
's' - String

## Statements & Control Flow

- import
- if
- while
- def
	- Function
- for

## import
This is how you include another python module or library in your code. 
You can do it like this:
`import modulename`

It pulls the entire module in, and then you can reference specific elements by using:
`modulename.elementname` 

## if
Check the True/False (Boolean) value of a statement and execute code conditionally.
```python
if (condition):
	print "True"
else:
	print "False"
```

## while
Also uses a boolean test condition, but executes the same code block repeatedly until that condition is no longer True.
```python
while (condition is True):
	print "True"
```

## def
defines a function object
```python
def functionname():
	functionbody
```

## for
It's not control flow, it's actually an iterator. However, for loops are one of the most elemental aspects of Python, and need to be discussed.
Here are some example of for statement
```python
list_of_words = ["This", "is", "a", "list"]
for word in list_of_words:
	print word,
```
```python
for i in range(101):
	print i*i
```
```python
list_of_words = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
for letter in list_of_words:
	if letter == 'a':
		print "Found a!"
```

## Expressions
- == - test equivalency
- <> - determine if a number is larger or smaller
- != - test inverse equivalency
- = - assigns value (Don't confuse with ==)
