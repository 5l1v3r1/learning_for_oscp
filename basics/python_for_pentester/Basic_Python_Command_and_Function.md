# Basic Python Command and Function

## I/O (Input/Output)
One of the basic tasks in any programming language, the ability to take input and give output is essential.

raw_input() - take input of any kind
print - display information to the screen

## Print Formatting
print "%[format_character]" % (corresponding data)
'd' - Signed integer decimal
'i' - Signed integer decimal
'x' - Signed hexadecimal
'e' - Floating point exponential format
'f' - Float point decimal format.
'c' - Single character
'r' - String
's' - String

## Statements & Control Flow

- import
- if
- while
- def
	- Function
- for

## import
This is how you include another python module or library in your code. 
You can do it like this:
`import modulename`

It pulls the entire module in, and then you can reference specific elements by using:
`modulename.elementname` 

## if
Check the True/False (Boolean) value of a statement and execute code conditionally.
```python
if (condition):
	print "True"
else:
	print "False"
```

## while
Also uses a boolean test condition, but executes the same code block repeatedly until that condition is no longer True.
```python
while (condition is True):
	print "True"
```

## def
defines a function object
```python
def functionname():
	functionbody
```

## for
It's not control flow, it's actually an iterator. However, for loops are one of the most
