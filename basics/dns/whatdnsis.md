# DNS
DNS is a naming system for computers that converts human readable domain names into computer readable IP-addresses. Some security vulnerabilities exist due to misconfigured DNS nameservers that can lead to information disclosure about the domain. This forms an important step of the information gathering stage during a Penestration test or Vulnerability assessment. 

### DNS Basics
 DNS converts human readable domain names into IP-addresses. This is because domain names are much easier to remember than IP-addresses. This process may take place through a local cache or through a zone file that is present on the server. A zone file is a file on the server that contains entries for different resource records (RR).
