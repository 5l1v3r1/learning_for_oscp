[How to use Google to Hack](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/use-google-hack-googledorks-0163566/)

## 1. History
The concept of "Google Hacking" date back to 2002, when Johnny Long began to collect interesting Google search queries that uncovered vulnerable systems and/or sensitive information disclosures - labeling them googleDorks. some people call it googlehacking.

**Dorks**:Someone who has odd interests, and is often silly at times. A dork is also someone who can be themselves and not care what anyone thinks

A Google Dork is an employee who unknowingly exposes sensitive corporate information on the Internet.

As a passive attack method, Google dorking can return usernames and passwords, email lists, sensitive documents, personally identifiable financial information and website vulnerabilities.

That information can be used for any number of illegal activities, including cyber terrorism, industrial espionage, identity theft and cyber stalking. 

## 2. Operators
As well as programming, google dorks also has its operators. Here are the most commonly used Operators.

Lets take a look at the special google search operators that are used to construct those high powered google hack search terms.

### intitle
Specifying intitle, will tell google to show only those pages that have the term in their html title. For example intitle:"login page" will show those pages which have the term "login page" in the title text.

### allintitle
Similar to intitle, but looks for all the specified terms in the title.

### inurl
Searches for the specified term in the url. For example inurl:"login.php".

### allinurl
Same as inurl, but searches for all terms in the url.

### filetype
Searchs for specific file types. filetypes:pdf wil looks for pdf files in websites.
Similarly filetype:txt looks for files with extension .txt

### ext
Similar to filetype. ext:pdf finds pdf extension files.

### intext
Searches the content of the page. Somewhat like a plain google search. For example intext:"index of /".

### allintext
Similar to intext, but searches for all terms to be present in the text.

### site
Limits the search to a specific site only. site:nullbyte.com

## 3. The formula of google dorks
Dorks: They are like search criteria in which a search engine returns results related to your dork.
The process can be a little time consuming, but the outcome will be worth it after learning on how to use dorks.

Basic Formula of dork, 
"inurl:."domain"/"dorks""

So you would normally understand it like this:
"inurl" = input URL
"domain" = your desired domain ex. .gov
"dorks" = your dork of your choice

Here is another example of that

You can use following words instead of inurl:

intitle:
inurl:
intext:
define:
site:
phonebook:
maps:
book:
froogle:
info:
movie:
weather:
related:
link:

All these also help you to find other things then vulnerables.

Anyway now I am going to explain you how to use some for finding vulnerability in websites.

### intitle
You can use the intitle to find anything in the title of the website. Which also could be useful to find downloads or anything else.

intitle: index of mp3

This is an example to download mp3 songs for free.

### inurl
the inurl basically looks for anything after the : in the site urls.

inurl:index.php?id=

### intext
You can find literally everything using intext, you could even use the inurl dorks with this.

intext:"Design & Developed By Seawind Solution Pvt.Ltd."

Google will give you all the websites created by IT Masons that recently has bypass Admin Page Vulnerability in some websites,

### define
Google will define this message and will look for what had this error for example,

define:"sql syntax error"

### site
Obvious, when we will use it, google will looks for a site.

site:wonderhowto.com

Google will look for any site related with wonderhowto.

### phonebook
It will look for the phone number related to me, so use your victims name or your instead.

phonebook:Mrnakupenda

### maps
Google will look on google maps for your search.

### books
Google has an online library store. If you want to find interesting books use this dork.

book:java language

### froogle:
Used for froogle search instead of google.

### info
google looks for anything you inputted but only information about string which you have putted next to info:

info:firefox
Above dork will show you a lot of things about firefox like what is firefox etc.

### movie
You can find information about movies on google using this dork.

movie:watch Transformers online

### weather
You can find information about weather on google using this dork.

weather: 01/08/2015 london

### related
This will look for anything related to what you have entered next to related:.

related:hacking

google responds with sites about hacking stuffs.

### link
This one will works better instead of only looking in search url, it will also look in the site for urls that possibly are vulnerable.

link:index.php?id=

This is very useful I would say even more than inurl.

## 4. Conclusion
Google dorks are very important, so I advise before you start your exploits against a particular victim the best way is to use google and see what you can find about the victim, and believe me, but using google, a lot of times I did not even turn on Linux kali, by simple search on google, I found the password of my victim.
