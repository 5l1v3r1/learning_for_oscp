# How to Capture Data Packets
When you first launch Wireshark a welcome screen similar to the one shown above should be visible, containing a list of available network connections on your current device. Displayed to the right of each list of each is an EKG-style line graph that represents live traffic on that respective network.

To begin capturing packets, first select one or more of these networks by clicking on your choice(s) and using the Shift or Ctrl keys if you'd like to record data from multiple networks simultaneously. Once a connection type is selected for capturing purposes, its background will be shaded in either blue or gray. Click on Capture from the main menu, located towards the top of the Wireshark interface. When the drop-down menu appears, select the Start option
