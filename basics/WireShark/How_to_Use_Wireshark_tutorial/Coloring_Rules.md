# Coloring Rules
While Wireshark's capture and display filters allow you to limit which packets are recorded or shown on the screen, its colorization functionality takes things a step further by making it easy to distinguish between different packet types based on their individual hue. This handy feature lets you quickly locate certain packets within a saved set by their row's color scheme in the packet list pane.
