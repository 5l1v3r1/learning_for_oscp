# Downloading and installing Wireshark
Wireshark can be downloaded at no cost from the [Wireshark Foundation](https://www.wireshark.org/#download) for both macOS and Windows operating systems. Unless you are an advanced user, it is recommended that you only download the latest stable release. During the setup process (Windows only) you should choose to also install WinPcap if prompted, as it includes a library required for live data capture.

The application is also available for Linux and most other UNIX-like platforms including Red Hat, Solaris, and FreeBSD. The binaries required for these operating systems can be found towards the bottom of the download page in the Third-Party Packages section.
You can also download Wireshark's source code from this page.
