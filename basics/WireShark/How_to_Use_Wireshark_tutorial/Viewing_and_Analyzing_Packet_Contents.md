# Viewing and Analyzing Packet Contents
Now that you've recorded some network data it's time to take a look at the captured packets. The captured data interface contains three main sections: The packet list pane, the packet details pane, and the packet bytes pane.

## Packet List
The packet list pane, located at the top of the window, shows all packets found in the active capture file. Each packet has its own row and corresponding number assigned to it, along with each of these data points.
- Time: the timestamp of when the packet was captured is displayed in this column, with the default format being the number of seconds since this specific capture
