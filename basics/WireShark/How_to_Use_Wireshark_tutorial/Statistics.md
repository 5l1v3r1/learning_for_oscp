# Statistics
In addition to the detailed information about your network's data shown in Wireshark's main window, several other useful metrics are available via the Statistics drop-down menu found towards the top of the screen. These include size and timing information about the capture file itself, along with dozens of charts and graphs ranging in topic from packet conversation breakdowns to load distribution of HTTP requests.

Display filter can be applied to many of these statistics via their individual interfaces, and the results can be exported to several file formats including CSV, XML, and txt.
